## original 
### [ ] give each actity and ID
### [ ] if we put the day start & end on #timeline block, 
and factor out the computations of start time and duration height, 
we could do panning an zooming by changing the day start & end on #timeline block, 

not a necessarily a wonderful permanent solution, but could work

it almost makes we want to do this in react...
