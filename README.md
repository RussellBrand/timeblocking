I am fond of the wallabyjs tool set.

Currently using `node` version 22.9.0.

The latest version of `node` is not support

### clicker/

Testing differentation of click & mouse down -- there has to be a better way to do this.

In chrome (132.0.6834.160) on my m1 mac (ventura 13.0.1), *click* is triggered after mouse up as long as the mouse has not moved regardless of how much time has has elapsed.
